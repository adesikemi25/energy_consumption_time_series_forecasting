# energy_consumption_time_series_forecasting
The aim of this project is to implement short-term time series energy consumption forecasting using LSTM and ANN deep learning models.Compare both deep learning approaches
performance.
The following are the project objectives:
Load the dataset for data quality checks
Carryout Data Exploratory data analysis
Carryout Data Pre-processing
Build the Model
Evaluate the model
Test the Model
